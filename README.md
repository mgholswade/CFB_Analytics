# CFB_Analytics
This repository was created as a catch all for personal projects dealing with Analysis of NCAA FBS Football. It currently contains a single project, dealing with creating football conferences based on team colors. This project is still being developed. This code is not ready to be run, but being published so that others may look into the methods used and suggest changes if/when they notice mistakes.

# Directories

## code
Currently empty, this will hopefully eventually contain ready to execute files that can be run from the command line to perform all of the analysis currently contained in the notebooks directory. 

## notebooks
This folder contains all of the python and R markdown files used for the initial analysis. This is the code base from which the executable files will be built, once a framework for the analysis is complete.

## data
This folder contains relevant data used in the project. Currently it only contains team and game data for the 2021 season, but this will be expanded later on. As data from more seasons is added and the size of the data files grows, this directory will be emptied and populated locally by an initialize script.

# How to use
This project in its current state is only suitable for use by developers familiar with python and R and with a high tolerance for sifting through sloppy code. Over time this section will be updated with instructions for end users.

## CFBD
All team and game data was retrieved using the collegefootballdata.com paython api. Instructions for using the api can be found here:
